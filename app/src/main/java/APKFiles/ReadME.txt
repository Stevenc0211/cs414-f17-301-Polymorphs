WARNING: Before placing the newest apk verify that it works and does not cause crashing. We should only place copies of the apk that are from working builds. So far the best way to verify is to check
with either Miles or Roger that the apk works on their phones. We don't want to place a copy of the apk if we know it is broken or unsure if it is broken in times when we need the apk itself.

When you add an apk, include the data in here, and also include the date of the apk you are adding, I think we should keep a series of apk's in this directory so that we can go back to older models if
need be.

Apk upload dates:
1.) 10/27/2017
